  'Goofspiel',
  'The objective of the game is to accumulate the most value in prizes by strategically bidding on them. Each player has 13 tokens valued from 1 to 13 respectively. Each round, the players use one of their tokens to make a secret bid on a randomly chosen prize, each valued from 1 to 13 and shown to all players. After each player has made their secret bid, the bids are revealed with the highest value token winning the prize and the tokens used to bid discarded. No one wins the prize if the bids are tied. The game continues with the next round revealing another randomly chosen prize from the remaining prize pool until there are no more tokens (or prizes) left. The winner is the player with the highest cumulative value of prizes won.',
